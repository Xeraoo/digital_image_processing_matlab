## Introduction

Digital image processing involves the manipulation of images using algorithms. This repository includes sample MATLAB scripts to perform essential tasks, including scaling, binarization, applying filters, analyzing histograms, and more. These examples are useful for students, researchers, and professionals interested in digital image processing.

## Features

- **Image Loading and Display:** Load images and visualize them in various formats.
- **Image Scaling and Binarization:** Resize and convert images to binary format for threshold-based applications.
- **Filtering Techniques:** Apply median, Gaussian, Wiener, and other filters to enhance or alter image characteristics.
- **Histogram Analysis:** Display and analyze histograms to understand the distribution of pixel values.
- **Profile Plotting:** Visualize intensity profiles along defined lines in an image.
- **Custom Image Transformations:** Modify color components, add frames, and create composite images.

## Usage

Open each MATLAB script, and run the sections to view results for various digital image processing techniques. Modify input parameters as necessary for experimenting with different images or filter sizes.

## Examples

Below are some example outputs for various scripts:

- **Image Scaling:** Original vs. Scaled Image
- **Binarization:** Grayscale to Binary Image
- **Filtering:** Histogram before and after Gaussian filtering
- **Profile Plotting:** Intensity profiles plotted along defined lines
